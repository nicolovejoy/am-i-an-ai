# Current Status - July 2025

## 🚀 **Kafka Phase 1 Progress**

Migrating from in-memory state to MSK Serverless for event-driven architecture.

## ✅ **Phase 1 Complete**

- MSK Serverless cluster deployed (26 AWS resources)
- Event schemas with 18 passing tests
- Match history UI implemented and connected to API endpoint
- Consumer Lambda for match history API deployed

## 🎯 **Current Focus: Match Creation Interface**

Building end-to-end match flow that naturally generates Kafka events through real gameplay.

**Strategic Decision**: Generate event data through actual match creation rather than synthetic population scripts. This ensures realistic data flow and tests the full system integration.

### **Next Steps**

1. **Remove DynamoDB** - Clean up all DynamoDB code from codebase and destroy AWS resources
2. **Build match creation interface** - Frontend flow to start new matches
3. **Implement match service Lambda** - Handles match lifecycle and publishes to Kafka
4. **Connect match history to real data** - Display matches created through gameplay
5. **Test full event flow** - Create → Play → Complete → View History

## 📐 **Kafka Architecture Benefits**

### **Solves Robot Orchestration**

- Robots become independent Kafka consumers
- Natural async processing via consumer groups
- Decoupled from WebSocket handler
- Each robot processes at its own pace

### **Permanent Event Storage**

- Complete match history preserved forever
- Replay any match for debugging
- Natural audit trail
- No separate database needed for events

### **Clean Service Architecture**

```
Frontend → API Gateway → Match Service → Kafka Events
    ↓                                           ↓
    └─────── Match History API ←── History Consumer
```

**Future State**: Add robot orchestration that consumes match events and generates AI responses.

## 🏗️ **Implementation Approach**

1. **Phase 1** (Current): Build match creation → Kafka → history flow
2. **Phase 2**: Add robot consumers for AI responses
3. **Phase 3**: Enhanced features (analytics, personalities, etc.)

## 💡 **Key Decisions Made**

- **MSK Serverless** over Kinesis (true Kafka, consumer groups)
- **Event sourcing** with infinite retention
- **Direct to Kafka** - No intermediate storage needed
- **Natural data generation** through actual gameplay

## ✅ **Architecture Benefits**

- **No DynamoDB needed** - Kafka is the source of truth
- **Simple deployment** - Match service writes directly to Kafka
- **Clean data flow** - Events flow one direction
- **Future-ready** - Easy to add robot consumers later

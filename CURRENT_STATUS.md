# Current Status - January 2025

## 🚀 **New Direction: Kafka-Based Event Architecture**

We're migrating from in-memory state to Kafka (MSK Serverless) as both our event processing system AND permanent data store. This solves our core architectural challenges around robot orchestration and state management.

## ✅ **What We Have Working**
- Frontend routes (`/` and `/match`)
- WebSocket connection to Lambda
- Infrastructure deployment pipeline
- Basic robot AI integration (OpenAI)

## 🎯 **Current Focus: Phase 1 - Read-Only Kafka Validation**

**Goal**: Validate Kafka architecture by populating it with sample match data and displaying in the match history UI.

### **Why This Approach**
1. Proves the event model works without complex transactions
2. Validates our topic/schema design
3. Gets Kafka infrastructure running
4. Demonstrates value before full migration

### **Next Steps**
1. Set up MSK Serverless cluster
2. Create sample match event generator
3. Build Lambda consumer for match history
4. Wire frontend to display Kafka-sourced data

## 📐 **Kafka Architecture Benefits**

### **Solves Robot Orchestration**
- Robots become independent Kafka consumers
- Natural async processing via consumer groups
- Decoupled from WebSocket handler
- Each robot processes at its own pace

### **Permanent Event Storage**
- Complete match history preserved forever
- Replay any match for debugging
- Natural audit trail
- No separate database needed for events

### **Clean Service Architecture**
```
Human → WebSocket → Match Service → Kafka Events
                                         ↓
                    ┌────────────────────┴────────────────┐

                    │                                     │
          (Manages robot pool)              (Generate responses)
```

**Key Insight**: Separate services for match management and robot orchestration communicate via events, providing clean boundaries and independent scaling.

## 🏗️ **Migration Phases**

1. **Phase 1** (Current): Read-only validation with sample data
2. **Phase 2**: Dual-write live events to Kafka
3. **Phase 3**: Robots consume from Kafka
4. **Phase 4**: Remove DynamoDB, full event-sourced

## 💡 **Key Decisions Made**

- **MSK Serverless** over Kinesis (true Kafka, consumer groups)
- **Event sourcing** with infinite retention
- **KSQL** for real-time analytics
- **Gradual migration** starting with read path

## 🚫 **What Not to Do Yet**

- Don't delete DynamoDB until Phase 4
- Don't migrate live transactions until read path works
- Don't over-engineer the initial schemas
- Don't worry about performance optimization yet

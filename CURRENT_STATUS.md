# Current Status - January 2025

## üìã Active Planning Documents

- **[Phase 3: Centralize State Logic](./PHASE3_CENTRALIZE_STATE_PLAN.md)** - Comprehensive plan to migrate all state transitions to match-service (7-9 hours estimated)
- **[Frontend State Migration](./frontend/TEST_PLAN.md)** - New React Query + Zod architecture to fix round 5 bug and improve state management

## üéÆ **RobotOrchestra Production MVP** (Updated: January 18, 2025)

### **‚úÖ What's Working**

- **Match Flow** - 5 rounds of prompts, responses, voting, and progression
- **End-of-Match** - Identity reveal, final scores, voting accuracy display
- **Robot Personalities** - 3 AI participants (philosopher, scientist, comedian)
- **AI Integration** - AWS Bedrock with Claude 3 models
- **Response Labels** - [AI] or [Fallback] tags for debugging
- **Prompt Display** - Shows original prompt on voting screen
- **Match History** - Lists all matches with dates and progress
- **Match Persistence** - Survives page refreshes via sessionStorage
- **Admin Panel** - Clear match data functionality at /admin

### **üêõ Known Issues (January 18, 2025)**

- **‚úÖ FIXED: Round 5 Bug** - Migrated to React Query architecture, all rounds now working
- **‚úÖ FIXED: Infinite Loop** - Resolved Zustand selector issues causing re-renders
- **Voting Page Issues** - Sometimes only showing user's response
  - Related to status transition timing issues
  - Phase 3 backend refactor will address this
- **Excessive API Polling** - Making too many calls to match endpoint
  - Need to optimize polling strategy or implement SSE
- **Prompts Not AI-Generated** - Currently using hardcoded prompt list
- **Admin Service** - Not deployed yet (Delete All Matches unavailable)
- **Match History Link** - Link from match complete page needs fixing

  --output json

# Check SQS queue
aws sqs get-queue-attributes \
  --queue-url $(aws sqs get-queue-url --queue-name robot-orchestra-robot-responses --query QueueUrl --output text) \
  --attribute-names All
```

### **üöÄ Next Steps**

1. **Fix Voting Interface Scroll Issue**

   - Add max-height and overflow-y-auto to responses container
   - Ensure all 4 responses are fully visible and scrollable
   - Test on different screen sizes

2. **Quick Wins**

   - Add debug mode to admin panel showing raw match state
   - Increase polling interval from 1s to 3-5s
   - Add comprehensive error logging

3. **Deploy Admin Service**

   - Add admin-service.ts to infrastructure
   - Enable "Delete All Matches" functionality

4. **Implement SSE**

   - Replace polling with Server-Sent Events
   - Real-time updates via DynamoDB Streams
   - Eliminate excessive API calls

5. **Phase 3: Architecture Refactor** ‚≠ê **[PLANNED - See detailed plan](./PHASE3_CENTRALIZE_STATE_PLAN.md)**

   - Centralize ALL state transitions in match-service
   - Add state-updates SQS queue for robot‚Üímatch-service notifications
   - Remove state logic from robot-worker completely
   - Implement proper event-driven coordination
   - Eliminates race conditions and simplifies debugging
   - Foundation for removing frontend polling

6. **Review Queueing Architecture** (Addressed in Phase 3)
   - Phase 3 adds proper SQS-based coordination
   - robot-worker notifies match-service of updates
   - Event-driven state transitions
   - Sets foundation for future SSE/WebSocket implementation

### **üí° Ideas for Future**

- Multi-human matches (2+ humans)
- Tournament mode
- Custom AI personalities
- Match replay functionality
- Performance analytics
- Mobile app
- **Async Play via Email/SMS**
  - SNS integration for notifications
  - Email notifications for turn alerts
  - SMS-based gameplay (respond via text)
  - Match invitations via email/SMS
  - Configurable notification preferences

### **üìã Known Good Configuration**

- **Prompts**: Creative and varied (10 unique philosophical prompts)
- **Robot Personalities**:
  - B: Philosopher (poetic, deep)
  - C: Scientist (analytical, precise)
  - D: Comedian (whimsical, playful)
- **Match Flow**: 5 rounds, 4 participants, voting after each round
- **Deployment**: Use ./scripts/deploy-lambdas.sh for Lambda updates

### **üí∞ Cost Status**

Current: ~$5-10/month (within budget)

- Lambda invocations
- DynamoDB storage/requests
- CloudFront/S3 hosting
- Minimal Bedrock usage (when working)

### **üîë Key System Insights**

- **Backend is working** - AI responses are being generated successfully
- **Issue is state flow** - Problem is in transitions and data synchronization
- **Too many moving parts** - Complex coordination between services
- **Need better observability** - Hard to debug without comprehensive logging
- **Human response missing** - Core issue is human response not saved to DynamoDB

### **üìä Architecture Analysis Summary**

**Current State Management Issues:**

1. **Distributed State Logic** - Both match-service and robot-worker manage state transitions
2. **Race Conditions** - Multiple services updating match state simultaneously
3. **No Coordination** - robot-worker updates aren't communicated back to match-service
4. **Complex Debugging** - Hard to trace state changes across services

**Phase 3 Solution:**

- Centralizes ALL state management in match-service
- Adds proper event-driven coordination via new SQS queue
- Makes system more maintainable and debuggable
- See [PHASE3_CENTRALIZE_STATE_PLAN.md](./PHASE3_CENTRALIZE_STATE_PLAN.md) for full implementation details

### **üéâ Major Migration Complete (January 18, 2025)**

1. **Successfully Migrated Frontend to React Query + Zod**

   - Replaced Redux-style state management with React Query
   - Added shared Zod schemas for type safety
   - Fixed the critical Round 5 bug
   - Resolved infinite loop issues with Zustand selectors

2. **Production Deployment Successful**

   - All 5 rounds working properly

### **üöÄ Previous Progress (January 16, 2025)**

1. **Identified Round 5 Bug Root Cause**

   - Frontend doesn't reset `hasSubmittedVote` when transitioning from round 4 to 5
   - State comparison uses stale closure causing reset logic to fail

2. **Designed New Frontend Architecture**

   - React Query for server state (automatic caching, polling, optimistic updates)
   - Minimal Zustand for UI-only state
   - Shared Zod schemas between frontend and backend
   - Created comprehensive migration plan

3. **Completed Migration**

   - ‚úÖ Created shared schema definitions in `/shared/schemas/`
   - ‚úÖ Set up React Query infrastructure
   - ‚úÖ Created v2 components demonstrating new patterns
   - ‚úÖ Migrated all components to use v2 versions
   - ‚úÖ Fixed TypeScript errors and dependency issues
   - ‚úÖ Installed missing packages (react-hot-toast, @aws-amplify/auth)
   - ‚úÖ Updated all imports to use new architecture

4. **Current State**

   - Frontend architecture migration complete
   - App runs with new React Query architecture
   - Some backend issues remain (presentation order, schema validation)
   - Sync engine temporarily disabled
   - Ready for production deployment after backend fixes

5. **Remaining Issues**
   - Backend returns incomplete presentation order (workaround implemented)
   - Schema validation temporarily bypassed due to API response format
   - Some TypeScript errors in old component files (not used)
   - Sync engine needs fixing for real-time updates
   - **Scroll issue in voting interface** - Can't scroll down far enough to see all 4 responses
     - Need to add proper max-height and overflow-y-auto to responses container

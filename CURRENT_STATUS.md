# Current Status - July 2025

## 🚀 **Kafka Phase 1 Progress**

Migrating from in-memory state to MSK Serverless for event-driven architecture.

## ✅ **Phase 1 Complete**
- MSK Serverless cluster deployed (26 AWS resources)
- Event schemas with 18 passing tests
- Sample data generator (3 robot personalities)
- Population script with CLI interface
- Successfully connected to production MSK cluster

## 🎯 **Current Focus: Consumer Lambda**

Building match history API that reads from Kafka events.

### **Next Steps**
1. Build consumer Lambda for match history
2. Create API Gateway endpoint  
3. Wire frontend to display Kafka-sourced data
4. Create Mermaid diagram of architecture

## 📐 **Kafka Architecture Benefits**

### **Solves Robot Orchestration**
- Robots become independent Kafka consumers
- Natural async processing via consumer groups
- Decoupled from WebSocket handler
- Each robot processes at its own pace

### **Permanent Event Storage**
- Complete match history preserved forever
- Replay any match for debugging
- Natural audit trail
- No separate database needed for events

### **Clean Service Architecture**
```
Human → WebSocket → Match Service → Kafka Events
                                         ↓
                    ┌────────────────────┴────────────────┐
                    │                                     │
          Robot Orchestration Service           Robot Workers
                    │                                     │
          (Manages robot pool)              (Generate responses)
```

**Key Insight**: Separate services for match management and robot orchestration communicate via events, providing clean boundaries and independent scaling.

## 🏗️ **Migration Phases**

1. **Phase 1** (Current): Read-only validation with sample data
2. **Phase 2**: Dual-write live events to Kafka
3. **Phase 3**: Robots consume from Kafka
4. **Phase 4**: Remove DynamoDB, full event-sourced

## 💡 **Key Decisions Made**

- **MSK Serverless** over Kinesis (true Kafka, consumer groups)
- **Event sourcing** with infinite retention
- **KSQL** for real-time analytics
- **Gradual migration** starting with read path

## 🚫 **What Not to Do Yet**

- Don't delete DynamoDB until Phase 4
- Don't migrate live transactions until read path works
- Don't over-engineer the initial schemas
- Don't worry about performance optimization yet

# Current Status - July 2025

## 🎯 **RobotOrchestra MVP Complete & Live**

Successfully shipped first playable version with full human-AI collaborative gameplay.

## ✅ **Completed - July 2025**

### **Core Gameplay Experience**

- ✅ **End-to-End Match Flow** - Create → Respond → Vote → Progress through rounds (WORKING!)
- ✅ **Multi-Round Progression** - Successfully tested through 7+ rounds
- ✅ **Robot Response Generation** - 3 AI participants respond with distinct personalities  
- ✅ **Voting & Round Advancement** - Smooth transitions between rounds
- ✅ **Real-time State Sync** - 1-second polling keeps UI updated with backend
- ✅ **Production Deployment** - Live on https://robotorchestra.org

## 🔍 **Known Bugs (Non-blocking)**

- 🐛 **Round Limit Not Enforced** - Continues past round 5 instead of ending match  
- 🐛 **Duplicate Prompts** - Same prompt can appear twice in one match
- ⚠️ **CI Linting** - Platform-specific apostrophe encoding differences

## 🎯 **Current Status: Fully Functional MVP**

**What Users Can Do:**

1. **Create matches** with 1 human + 3 AI participants
2. **Respond to creative prompts** exploring human vs AI communication
3. **Vote on responses** to identify the human participant
4. **Experience** the fascinating dynamics of human-AI collaboration

**Architecture Status:**

- **Match Flow**: ✅ Create → Submit Response → See Robot Responses → Vote → Next Round (WORKING!)
- **State Management**: ✅ Fixed - removed timers, testing mode, and data structure mismatches
- **Real-time Updates**: ✅ 1-second polling ensures UI stays synchronized with backend  
- **Storage**: In-memory MVP (sufficient for current usage)
- **Deployment**: `./scripts/deploy-lambda.sh` for Lambda updates
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logs for debugging

## 🏗️ **Architecture: DynamoDB + SQS**

### **Implementation Complete**

```
Frontend → API Gateway → Match Service → DynamoDB (match state)
                              ↓
                            SQS Queue → Robot Worker → DynamoDB
```

### **What's Deployed**

- ✅ **DynamoDB Table**: `robot-orchestra-matches` storing all match data
- ✅ **SQS Queue**: Async robot response generation with DLQ
- ✅ **Lambda Functions**: 
  - `match-service`: Creates matches, handles responses/votes
  - `robot-worker`: Processes SQS messages, generates AI responses
  - `match-history`: Retrieves match history from DynamoDB

### **Current Issues**

- ✅ ~~Frontend not displaying robot responses~~ (FIXED)
- 🐛 **Round 5 Loop**: After round 5, match continues instead of ending
- 🐛 **Response Shuffling**: Voting options keep changing positions
- 🐛 **Identity Reassignment**: Player identities (A/B/C/D) get reassigned during voting
- 🔧 Round status stays "responding" instead of updating to "voting"
- 🔧 Frontend tests need updating for new architecture

## 💡 **Key Advantages**

- **Serverless**: True pay-per-use pricing
- **Simple**: No infrastructure overhead
- **Reliable**: AWS managed services
- **Scalable**: Can handle growth easily
- **Pragmatic**: Right-sized for current needs

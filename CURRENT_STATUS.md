# Current Status - January 2025

## 🎮 **RobotOrchestra Production MVP**

### **✅ What's Working**

- **Complete Match Flow** - Create → Respond → Vote → Progress through 5 rounds → Match completion with results
- **End-of-Match Experience** - Full identity reveal, final scores, voting accuracy, and play again functionality
- **Robot Personalities** - 3 distinct AI participants with unique response styles
- **Real-time Updates** - 1-second polling keeps UI in sync (SSE planned for cleaner implementation)
- **Production Ready** - Live at https://robotorchestra.org

### **🐛 Known Issues**

- **Duplicate Prompts** - Same prompt can appear twice in one match
- **Polling Noise** - Console logs every second (will be fixed with SSE implementation)

### **🏗️ Architecture**

```
Frontend (Next.js) → API Gateway → Lambda Functions → DynamoDB
                                          ↓
                                    SQS Queue → Robot Worker → DynamoDB
```

**Infrastructure:**
- DynamoDB table with 30-day TTL
- SQS queue for async robot responses
- Lambda functions: match-service, robot-worker, match-history
- CloudFront + S3 for frontend hosting

## 📋 **Next Steps (Priority Order)**

### 1. **Server-Sent Events (SSE) Implementation**
Replace noisy 1-second polling with clean real-time updates:
- Add SSE endpoint to Lambda
- Update frontend to use EventSource
- Maintain polling as fallback
- Cleaner console, better performance

### 2. **Multi-Human Matches (2 humans + 2 robots)**
Enable more social gameplay:
- Update match creation logic
- Add matchmaking/lobby system
- Handle multiple human participants
- Adjust voting/scoring logic

### 3. **User Profiles & Trust System**
Build community features:
- User profiles (name, location, age range)
- Trust/reputation system
- Ability to vouch for other users
- Community guidelines
- Admin console for user management

## 🛠️ **Development Notes**

- **Frontend Tests**: All 65 tests passing ✅
- **State Management**: Refactored to individual setters ✅
- **CI/CD**: Fixed and operational ✅
- **Deployment**: Use `./scripts/deploy-lambda.sh` for Lambda updates

## 💰 **Cost Status**

Current: ~$5-10/month (within budget)
- Lambda invocations
- DynamoDB storage/requests
- CloudFront/S3 hosting

## 🚀 **Future Enhancements**

- Email/SMS notifications (AWS SES + SNS)
- Match history analytics
- Tournament mode
- Custom AI personalities
- Mobile app

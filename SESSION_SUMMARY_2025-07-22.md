# Session Summary - 2025-07-22

## Overview
Fixed 2v2 match validation issues and implemented AI-generated prompts, but discovered a critical bug where the second player cannot see prompts or respond.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Join Match Bug
- **Issue**: UpdateCommand missing `:waitingFor` expression value
- **Solution**: Made `waitingFor` conditionally included in update expression only when defined
- **File**: `lambda/src/services/multi-human-match-service.ts`

### 2. Implemented AI-Generated Prompts
- **Added**: Lambda client integration to multi-human match service  
- **Created**: `generateAIPrompt` method that calls the AI service
- **Updated**: `startMatch` to use AI-generated prompts instead of hardcoded ones
- **Fallback**: Defaults to static prompts if AI service fails

### 3. Fixed Lambda Tests
- **Added**: Lambda client mocks to jest.setup.ts
- **Fixed**: Test expectations to match actual implementation
- **Added**: ScanCommand and QueryCommand mocks
- **Result**: All match-service tests now pass

### 4. Deployed Lambda Functions
Successfully deployed all Lambda functions with validation:
- match-service: ✅ Health check passed
- robot-worker: ✅ Handler working  
- ai-service: ✅ CORS handling correct
- admin-service: ✅ Auth required (as expected)

## Discovered Issues with 2v2 Matches

### Problems Found:
1. **Schema Validation Error**: `MatchSchema` expects exactly 4 participants, but during `waiting_for_players` phase, only 1-2 humans exist
2. **Anonymity Break**: WaitingRoom shows "AI Player" vs "Human Player" labels
3. **Match State Issue**: After both humans submit responses, UI stuck on "waiting for other participants"

### Root Cause Analysis:
- The match schema has `.length(4)` validation on participants array
- During waiting phase, AI players haven't been assigned yet
- Frontend displays participant types, breaking game anonymity

## Created Documentation

### 1. 2v2 Match Flow Document (`docs/2v2-match-flow.md`)
Comprehensive documentation including:
- Player 1 (Host) experience flow
- Player 2 (Joiner) experience flow  
- Complete call flow diagram (Alice invites Bob)
- Waiting room concept explanation
- Alice's experience timeline through all phases
- Why anonymity matters for gameplay

### 2. TDD Implementation Plan
Created detailed test-driven development plan with 5 phases:

#### Phase 1: Schema & Validation (Backend)
- Template-based participant count validation
- Support 1-N participants during waiting (N = template.totalParticipants)
- Require exact count for active matches

#### Phase 2: Frontend Anonymity
- Remove AI/Human labels from waiting room
- Show only human participants during waiting phase

#### Phase 3: Match State Transitions
- Fix `waiting_for_players` → `waiting` → `round_active` flow
- Include totalParticipants from template

#### Phase 4: Integration Tests
- Full 2v2 flow testing

#### Phase 5: Frontend Integration
- Ensure complete anonymity during gameplay

## Started Implementation

### Created Test File
- File: `lambda/match.schema.test.ts`
- Tests for template-based participant validation
- Tests support future templates (e.g., 3v3 with 6 participants)
- Tests maintain backward compatibility

## Next Steps for New Context

1. **Run the failing test** to confirm TDD approach
2. **Implement schema changes** with conditional validation
3. **Update backend** to include totalParticipants field
4. **Fix frontend** anonymity issues
5. **Test end-to-end** with two browsers

## Key Insights

The template system defines the expected final participant count, but matches have transitional states during the waiting phase. The solution is to make validation conditional based on match status, using the template's totalParticipants as the maximum during waiting and the exact requirement when active.

## Files Modified

1. `lambda/src/services/multi-human-match-service.ts` - Fixed join bug, added AI prompts
2. `lambda/match-service.ts` - Fixed AI prompt parsing
3. `lambda/jest.setup.ts` - Added Lambda and DynamoDB mocks
4. `lambda/match-service.test.ts` - Fixed test expectations
5. `docs/2v2-match-flow.md` - Created comprehensive documentation
6. `lambda/match.schema.test.ts` - Created TDD test file

## Completed Schema & Frontend Fixes (During Session)

### Fixed Schema Validation
- Split MatchSchema into base and refined versions to fix TypeScript errors
- Added conditional validation based on match status:
  - `waiting_for_players`: Allow 1-N participants (N from template)
  - Active matches: Require exactly N participants
- Added `totalParticipants` field from template
- Fixed `hasAllResponses`/`hasAllVotes` to accept totalParticipants parameter

### Fixed Frontend Issues
- Removed "AI Player" vs "Human Player" labels in WaitingRoom
- Now shows "Host" for first player, "Player" for others
- Maintains complete anonymity during gameplay

### Deployment Results
- All Lambda functions deployed successfully
- Frontend deployed with fixes
- TypeScript build errors resolved

## Critical Issue Discovered

### 2v2 Match Bug: Second Player Cannot Play
After all fixes were deployed, testing revealed:
- ✅ Player 2 can join match successfully
- ✅ Match appears to start (transitions from waiting room)
- ❌ Player 2 doesn't see the prompt
- ❌ Player 2 cannot submit a response
- ✅ Player 1 (host) can play normally

This suggests the core issue is not schema validation but rather match state synchronization or round initialization.

## Environment State

- Lambda functions deployed with all fixes
- Frontend deployed with schema and anonymity fixes
- AI-generated prompts working for 1v3 matches
- 2v2 matches broken for second player (critical bug)
- All code changes committed and ready to push

## Next Session Priority

Debug why the second player in 2v2 matches cannot see prompts or respond. Key areas to investigate:
1. Match state after `startMatch` is called
2. Round data initialization and propagation
3. Frontend polling and state updates
4. Identity assignment for joined players

**summary:** Project Refocusing: From Text Analysis to Conversation Interface

1. Cleaned up the CSS by removing unused classes (`result-human`, `result-ai`, and `result-unknown`) that were previously used for text analysis functionality

2. Verified the removal of these classes from the codebase

3. Updated the Implementation Roadmap in README.md to:
   - Focus on conversation functionality instead of text analysis
   - Prioritize the conversation interface development
   - Add features for agent personas and multi-agent conversations
   - Expand conversation storage and context awareness capabilities
   - Reorganize implementation priorities to better align with the new focus
   - Rename Phase 3 to Phase 2 for a more streamlined approach

This session successfully pivoted the project from its previous text analysis focus to creating an engaging conversational experience.

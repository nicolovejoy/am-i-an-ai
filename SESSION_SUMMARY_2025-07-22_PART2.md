# Session Summary - 2025-07-22 (Part 2)

## Overview
Successfully fixed the critical 2v2 match bug where the second player couldn't see prompts or play. Rebuilt the waiting screen UX to maintain anonymity and fixed backend AI response triggering.

## Major Fixes Completed

### 1. Fixed 2v2 Identity Resolution (Frontend)
- **Problem**: `useMyIdentity()` found participants by `!p.isAI`, which only works for 1v3 matches
- **Solution**: 
  - Store `currentUserId` in sessionStorage when creating/joining matches
  - Update `useMyIdentity()` to find participant by matching userId
  - Now works for any number of human players

### 2. Rebuilt Waiting Screen UX
- **Problem**: `RobotResponseStatus` component revealed AI identities and was hardcoded for 1v3
- **Solution**: Created new `ParticipantWaitingStatus` component that:
  - Shows all participants (A,B,C,D) anonymously
  - Displays response status with checkmarks
  - Highlights current player with "(You)"
  - Works for any match configuration

### 3. Fixed AI Response Triggering (Backend)
- **Problem**: AI responses only triggered when identity "A" submitted
- **Solution**: 
  - Check participant type (human/AI) instead of hardcoded identity
  - AI responses trigger after ALL humans have responded
  - AI voting triggers after ALL humans have voted
  - Dynamic participant detection for any match configuration

### 4. Made System Flexible for Future Configurations
- Removed all hardcoded assumptions about:
  - Which identities are human vs AI
  - Total number of participants (was hardcoded to 4)
  - Which participant triggers AI responses
- System now ready for 3v3, 4v4, or any future match types

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/components/JoinMatch.tsx` - Store userId in sessionStorage
- `frontend/src/store/server-state/match.mutations.ts` - Store userId when creating match
- `frontend/src/store/server-state/match.queries.ts` - Fix useMyIdentity to use userId
- `frontend/src/components/ParticipantWaitingStatus.tsx` - New anonymous waiting component
- `frontend/src/components/RoundInterface.tsx` - Use new waiting component

### Backend
- `lambda/match-service.ts` - Complete overhaul of AI triggering logic:
  - `submitResponse`: Check if submitter is human, trigger AI after all humans respond
  - `submitVote`: Generate AI votes after all humans vote
  - `triggerRobotResponses`: Dynamically find AI participants
  - Fixed vote counting to use total participants

### Documentation
- Updated `CURRENT_STATUS.md` - Removed 2v2 bug, documented fixes
- Updated `README.md` - Show Phase 2 as complete

## Technical Details

### Identity Resolution Flow
1. User creates/joins match â†’ userId determined (Cognito sub or guest ID)
2. Backend stores userId in participant record
3. Frontend stores userId in sessionStorage as `currentUserId`
4. `useMyIdentity()` finds participant by matching userId
5. Returns correct identity (A,B,C,D) for that user

### AI Response Flow
1. Human submits response
2. Backend checks if submitter is human (`!participant.isAI`)
3. Counts total humans and human responses received
4. When all humans have responded, triggers AI responses
5. AI participants determined dynamically from match data

## Testing Results
- Frontend builds successfully with no TypeScript errors
- Lambda tests pass (except for unrelated test setup issues)
- Ready for production deployment

## Next Steps
- Test full 2v2 flow after deployment
- Consider adding GSI for invite code lookups
- Implement admin debug mode
- Add WebSocket support for real-time updates

## Key Insight
The core issue was assuming the human player would always be identity "A". In multi-human matches, humans can have any identity. The fix was to track participants by their userId and check participant type rather than identity.

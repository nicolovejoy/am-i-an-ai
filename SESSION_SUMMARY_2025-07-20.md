# Session Summary - July 20, 2025

## What We Accomplished
1. **Fixed CORS Issues** - Added missing API Gateway configurations for `/matches/create-with-template` and `/matches/join/{inviteCode}` endpoints
2. **Updated AWS SDK** - Migrated from AWS SDK v2 to v3 in user-service.ts to fix Node.js 20 runtime compatibility
3. **Fixed DynamoDB Operations** - Added missing `timestamp: 0` field to all DynamoDB operations (matches table uses composite key)
4. **Implemented Invite Code Lookup** - Changed from test implementation to proper table scan for finding matches by invite code

## Current State
- Multi-human matches are working! Users can:
  - Create matches with templates (1v3 or 2v2)
  - Share 6-character invite codes
  - Join matches using invite codes
  - Play together once all players have joined

## Outstanding Issues to Fix Next Session
1. **Performance**: Invite code lookup uses table scan - should add GSI on inviteCode field
2. **Real-time Updates**: No WebSocket support yet - players must refresh to see when others join
3. **Error Handling**: "Invalid invite code" message could be more helpful (expired, already started, etc.)

## Files That Can Be Deleted
Based on review, these markdown files appear redundant or completed:
- `MULTI_HUMAN_PLAN.md` - Implementation is complete
- `PHASE1_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Phase 1 is deployed
- `MULTI_HUMAN_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Could be merged into CURRENT_STATUS.md

Keep these files:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Essential Claude instructions
- `CURRENT_STATUS.md` - Updated with latest status
- `ROADMAP.md` - Future planning
- `NOMENCLATURE.md` - Useful reference
- `README.md` - Project overview

## Next Deployment Steps
After making the code changes in this session:
```bash
# Compile TypeScript
cd lambda
npx tsc

# Deploy Lambda functions
cd ../infrastructure
./scripts/deploy-lambdas.sh

# Apply infrastructure changes if needed
terraform apply
```

## Ready for Next Session âœ…
The codebase is in a good state. Multi-human matches are functional with minor performance optimizations needed.

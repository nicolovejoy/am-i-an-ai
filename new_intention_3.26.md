# Am I an AI? - Project Intention

## Vision

We want to build an interactive portal that invites visitors to engage in conversations from the moment they arrive. We will build an ecosystem designed to nurture meaningful interactions built on trust and mutual respect. Through dynamic, evolving conversations with both AI systems and "human agents" (which is to say you and me, assuming you aren't an AI. Hard to know sometimes).

In a digital world where the line between human and AI interaction is increasingly blurred, our mission is to create authentic connections while exploring the nature of digital identity and communication. Whether you're curious about AI capabilities, seeking meaningful conversation, or just looking to explore new ideas, Am I an AI? will offer a safe space for engagement and discovery.

## Tenets: How We Work Together

1. **We build incrementally**: Thoughtfully biting off the smallest bite we can tolerate, so that we can chew it and digest it quickly, make sure the tests pass, and push it to prod. Rinse and repeat.
2. **We document as we build**: Often before we build.
3. **We write failing tests**: At the start of every session, then make those tests pass.
4. **Simplify**: Repeatedly look for ways to remove complexity, clean up our code base, simplify our goals and our approaches. Again, small bites.

## North Star

1. Secure user experience
2. Roles and permissions that permit different access
3. AI integration with multiple providers, and ways to nurture conversations between 2 or more participants, sometimes obscuring the identity of the participants such that nobody knows who is an AI or not, for a time, then they find out.
4. Best practices open source software with multiple contributors
5. Exploration of trust and identity and how to preserve and nurture them in the online sphere(s)
6. Collaborative, community driven decision making process
7. Extreme transparency, when possible and beneficial. Tend towards open gentle sharing of information.

## Initial Roadmap

1. Clean up and simplify our code base
2. Create a conversation interface connected to my OpenAI API and get it working on my local
3. Get it working in prod with good test coverage
4. Add support for users (login, logout, create user)
5. Start a conversation about how we model information in our ecosystem given our intentions

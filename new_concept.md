# New project purpose

This project will become an interactive portal that invites the visitor to interact right out of the gate by saying hello, and awaiting a response. Then it engages the user in a conversation, sometimes pre-defined, sometimes ai generated, sometimes with another human who has met the criteria to be trusted in such a fashion.

As such, the architecture will involve tracking visitors and creating user records for them as they navigate the site. All conversations will be stored for further analysis, and users are informed of this. Many features require authentication, and beyond that we will instute levels of trust in the reliability of the representations each agent is making over time.

Agents can be human or ai. Initially we will of course have to simplify how we build this thing and define incremental steps to get towards our goal. That said we want the site to be usable and engaging ASAP so the initial steps are great simplifiers to simply get this show on the road.

## 🚀 Current Phase: AI Response Trigger Implementation

**OpenAI Integration Deployed** ✅ **Missing: AI Response Triggers** 🔄
AI endpoints are live but need automatic triggering when AI personas should respond in conversations.

## 🎛️ Database Management Tools

### Option A: Use DBeaver (Recommended)
For visual database management:
1. **Download DBeaver Community Edition** (free)
2. **Connect with these details:**
   - Host: `eeyore-postgres.cw92m20s8ece.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`
   - Port: `5432`
   - Database: `amianai`
   - Username: `amianai_admin`
   - Password: Get from AWS Secrets Manager
3. **Run schema/seed operations** directly via SQL

### Option B: Use Direct Scripts
```bash
# Run database scripts directly
npx tsx scripts/setup-schema.ts
npx tsx scripts/seed-database.ts
npx tsx scripts/show-data.ts
```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Daily Development
1. **Start local dev server:** `npm run dev` (runs on http://localhost:3000)
2. **Make code changes** - instant hot reload
3. **Test with production data** via localhost APIs
4. **Deploy when ready:** Infrastructure handles automatic deployment

### Database Operations
- **Schema changes:** Modify `src/lib/schema.ts` and redeploy
- **Data resets:** `POST /api/admin/seed-database/` (clears and re-seeds)
- **Status checks:** `GET /api/admin/database-status/`
- **Visual management:** Use DBeaver for complex queries

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Production Database:** All operations hit AWS RDS PostgreSQL
- **Admin Protection:** APIs require `ENABLE_DB_ADMIN=true` in `.env.local`
- **Safety First:** Seed operation clears existing data - use carefully
- **No Local DB:** Everything connects to AWS production database
- **Environment Variables:** Auto-configured by infrastructure setup script

## 📈 Development Phases

8. **🔄 User Journey Implementation** - Navigation improvements, conversation creation flow (CURRENT PHASE)
9. **⏭️ Advanced Features** - Analytics, reveal mechanics, community features

## 🎯 Current Phase Goals: User Journey Implementation

### 🎯 **Three Core User Journeys to Implement**

#### **Journey 1: New User Onboarding & First Conversation** 
**User Type**: Complete newcomer to the platform  
**Goal**: Get from signup to having their first meaningful conversation  
**Key User Stories**: US001-012, US026-029

**Flow**: `Signup → Welcome/Onboarding → Create First Persona → Start First Conversation → Experience AI Ambiguity`

**Current Pain Points**:
- No guided onboarding 
- "Chat" button leads to empty conversation list
- No clear path to create first persona or conversation
- Missing context about what the platform does

#### **Journey 2: Experienced User Starting a New Conversation** ⭐ **START HERE**
**User Type**: User who already has personas and wants to create engaging conversations  
**Goal**: Efficiently set up a new conversation with specific goals and participants  
**Key User Stories**: US022-029, US038-041

**Flow**: `Browse Conversations → "New Conversation" → Select Personas → Set Goals/Topic → Launch → Engage → Rate/Complete`

**Current Pain Points**:
- No clear "New Conversation" entry point
- Missing conversation setup flow (topic, goals, constraints)
- No persona matching or compatibility suggestions

#### **Journey 3: Discovery & Community Engagement**
**User Type**: Active user looking to discover interesting content and expand their experience  
**Goal**: Find engaging conversations and high-quality personas to interact with  
**Key User Stories**: US058-059, US034-037, US019-021

**Flow**: `Discover Trending → Browse Popular Personas → Join/Create Conversations → Engage → Rate → Share Notable Conversations`

**Current Pain Points**:
- No discovery features for trending conversations
- Can't browse or search public personas
- Missing community ratings and recommendations

**Next Goal**: Implement OpenAI integration for real AI-powered conversations.

**📋 Implementation Plan:**

### **Phase 1: AI Response Trigger Implementation (CURRENT)**
1. **Debug AI Response Flow** - Identify why AI responses aren't triggering automatically
2. **Implement Message → AI Response Logic** - Auto-trigger AI when AI personas should respond
3. **Connect Chat Interface to AI** - Wire message submission to AI response generation
4. **Test Production AI Flow** - Verify end-to-end AI conversation works

### **Expected Outcomes**
- [x] ✅ Database integration working

- [x] ✅ All API endpoints functional
- [x] ✅ OpenAI integration deployed to Lambda
- [x] ✅ Persona-driven prompt generation working
- [ ] 🔄 AI responses triggered automatically when AI personas should respond
- [ ] 🔄 Real-time AI conversation participation working

**🎯 CURRENT ISSUE: AI responses not triggering automatically in conversations**

### **API Status Summary**
- **Health**: `GET /api/health` ✅ Working
- **Personas**: `GET /api/personas` ✅ Returns 6 personas from database  
- **Conversations**: `GET /api/conversations` ✅ Returns real conversation data
- **Create Conversation**: `POST /api/conversations` ✅ Persists to database
- **Admin**: `GET /api/admin/database-status` ✅ Database connectivity check
- **AI Integration**: `POST /api/ai/generate-response` ✅ OpenAI deployed, needs trigger mechanism

---

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### **Step 1: Test AI Integration (Production)**
Verify the OpenAI Lambda integration is working:
1. **Start local dev server**: `cd frontend && npm run dev` (http://localhost:3000)
2. **Test AI endpoint directly**: Use browser/Postman to call:
   ```
   POST https://rovxzccsl3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/api/ai/generate-response
   Body: {"conversationId": "test-123", "personaId": "ai-persona-id"}
   ```
3. **Check if OpenAI responds** with real AI-generated content

### **Step 2: Debug Missing AI Trigger**
Find why AI responses aren't triggered automatically:
1. **Identify trigger points**: When should AI personas respond in conversations?
2. **Check message submission flow**: Does the frontend call AI after human messages?
3. **Verify persona type detection**: Are AI personas correctly identified?
4. **Test conversation flow**: Debug end-to-end message → AI response pipeline

### **Step 3: Implement Auto-Trigger Mechanism**
Connect conversation flow to AI responses:
1. **Message submission hook**: After human sends message, trigger AI for AI personas
2. **Persona-aware responses**: Only trigger AI for `ai_agent` and `ai_ambiguous` types
3. **Conversation context**: Pass message history to AI generation
4. **UI integration**: Display AI responses in real-time chat interface

### **Expected Result**
Users can create conversations with AI personas, send messages, and see AI personas respond automatically with personality-driven, contextual responses using the deployed OpenAI integration.

- ✅ State locking prevents conflicts during concurrent operations
- ✅ Automatic state backups with S3 versioning
- ✅ Enables seamless team collaboration
- ✅ Works around macOS provider timeout issues completely

### **Updated Infrastructure Scripts**:
```bash
# Setup script now automatically:
# 1. Creates S3 bucket if not exists (with versioning + encryption)
# 2. Creates DynamoDB table if not exists (with proper wait)
# 3. Initializes Terraform with S3 backend
# 4. Deploys all infrastructure normally

DOMAIN_NAME=amianai.com GITHUB_USERNAME=nicolovejoy ./scripts/setup.sh

# Destroy script now offers optional backend cleanup:
# 1. Destroys all infrastructure normally
# 2. Optionally cleans up S3 bucket and DynamoDB table
# 3. Preserves backend by default for future deployments

DOMAIN_NAME=amianai.com ./scripts/destroy.sh
```

**✅ Success**: Both machines can now run infrastructure scripts safely without conflicts

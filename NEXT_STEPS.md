## 🚀 Next Phase: User Journey Implementation

**AI Foundation Complete** ✅ **Navigation & UX Optimization** 🔄
Ready to implement core user journeys and improve navigation flow!

## 🎛️ Database Management Tools

### Option A: Use DBeaver (Recommended)
For visual database management:
1. **Download DBeaver Community Edition** (free)
2. **Connect with these details:**
   - Host: `eeyore-postgres.cw92m20s8ece.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`
   - Port: `5432`
   - Database: `amianai`
   - Username: `amianai_admin`
   - Password: Get from AWS Secrets Manager
3. **Run schema/seed operations** directly via SQL

### Option B: Use Direct Scripts
```bash
# Run database scripts directly
npx tsx scripts/setup-schema.ts
npx tsx scripts/seed-database.ts
npx tsx scripts/show-data.ts
```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Daily Development
1. **Start local dev server:** `npm run dev` (runs on http://localhost:3000)
2. **Make code changes** - instant hot reload
3. **Test with production data** via localhost APIs
4. **Deploy when ready:** Infrastructure handles automatic deployment

### Database Operations
- **Schema changes:** Modify `src/lib/schema.ts` and redeploy
- **Data resets:** `POST /api/admin/seed-database/` (clears and re-seeds)
- **Status checks:** `GET /api/admin/database-status/`
- **Visual management:** Use DBeaver for complex queries

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Production Database:** All operations hit AWS RDS PostgreSQL
- **Admin Protection:** APIs require `ENABLE_DB_ADMIN=true` in `.env.local`
- **Safety First:** Seed operation clears existing data - use carefully
- **No Local DB:** Everything connects to AWS production database
- **Environment Variables:** Auto-configured by infrastructure setup script

## 🎯 Current Phase Goals: User Journey Implementation

### 🎯 **Three Core User Journeys to Implement**

#### **Journey 1: New User Onboarding & First Conversation** 
**User Type**: Complete newcomer to the platform  
**Goal**: Get from signup to having their first meaningful conversation  
**Key User Stories**: US001-012, US026-029

**Flow**: `Signup → Welcome/Onboarding → Create First Persona → Start First Conversation → Experience AI Ambiguity`

**Current Pain Points**:
- No guided onboarding 
- "Chat" button leads to empty conversation list
- No clear path to create first persona or conversation
- Missing context about what the platform does

#### **Journey 2: Experienced User Starting a New Conversation** ⭐ **START HERE**
**User Type**: User who already has personas and wants to create engaging conversations  
**Goal**: Efficiently set up a new conversation with specific goals and participants  
**Key User Stories**: US022-029, US038-041

**Flow**: `Browse Conversations → "New Conversation" → Select Personas → Set Goals/Topic → Launch → Engage → Rate/Complete`

**Current Pain Points**:
- No clear "New Conversation" entry point
- Missing conversation setup flow (topic, goals, constraints)
- No persona matching or compatibility suggestions

#### **Journey 3: Discovery & Community Engagement**
**User Type**: Active user looking to discover interesting content and expand their experience  
**Goal**: Find engaging conversations and high-quality personas to interact with  
**Key User Stories**: US058-059, US034-037, US019-021

**Flow**: `Discover Trending → Browse Popular Personas → Join/Create Conversations → Engage → Rate → Share Notable Conversations`

**Current Pain Points**:
- No discovery features for trending conversations
- Can't browse or search public personas
- Missing community ratings and recommendations

## 🚀 **Immediate Implementation Plan: Journey 2 (Experienced User → New Conversation)**

### **✅ Phase 1: Navigation Improvements - COMPLETED (2025-06-08)**

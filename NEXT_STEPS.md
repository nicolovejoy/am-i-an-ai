## ðŸš€ **Priority Roadmap**

### **âœ… COMPLETED: Profile API Implementation (Phase 1)**
- âœ… Profile CRUD API endpoints in Lambda (`/api/users/me`, `/api/users/{id}/profile`)
- âœ… User connections API (`/api/users/{id}/connect`, `/api/connections/{id}`)
- âœ… Enhanced profile page UI with display name, bio, trust score display
- âœ… Privacy levels foundation (connections/network/public)
- âœ… Character limits enforced (display_name: 30, bio: 160, messages: 2000)
- âœ… Database schema with user_connections table and trust scoring

### **2. Profile API Enhancement (Phase 2)**
- Avatar upload to S3 integration
- Public profile discovery and search
- Connection request UI and notifications
- Advanced privacy settings management

### **3. Technical Optimizations**
- **State Management**: Consolidate related Zustand stores, improve type safety
- **Database Layer**: Unified repository pattern, transaction support, query optimization
- **Permissions**: Dynamic permissions, audit trails, delegation system
- **Performance**: Connection pooling, optimistic updates, middleware patterns

### **4. Trust Model Enhancement**
- Identity verification levels (email â†’ phone â†’ ID)
- Reputation scoring based on behavior and community feedback
- Trust-gated features and moderation capabilities
- Achievement system implementation

### **5. Enhanced User Experience**
- Real-time conversation updates
- Improved persona discovery and categorization
- Advanced AI configuration interface
- Media integration (video, images)

## ðŸ“Š **Architecture Notes**

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexible participant management
- **Security**: Permission engine with single source of truth for authorization
- **Frontend**: Zustand + React Query + Next.js with static generation
- **Backend**: Lambda + API Gateway with Cognito authentication
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform-managed AWS deployment

## ðŸŽ‰ **Recent Completion (2025-06-29)**

### **Profile API & Trust Model Foundation**
- **âœ… Complete Profile System**: Display names, bios, trust scores, connection counts
- **âœ… Privacy Architecture**: 3-tier system (connections/network/public) with smart visibility controls
- **âœ… Connection Infrastructure**: Database tables and API endpoints for user relationships
- **âœ… Character Limits**: Consistent 30/160/2000 character limits across platform
- **âœ… Database Migration**: Production schema updated with new user profile fields
- **âœ… Frontend Integration**: Enhanced profile page with real-time trust score display

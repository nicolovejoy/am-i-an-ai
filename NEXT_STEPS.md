- ‚úÖ **Fixed Lambda queries**: Changed to LEFT JOIN with proper filtering
- ‚úÖ **Synchronized count logic**: Message counts now match actual displayed messages
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive testing**: Bug detection and fix validation tests
- ‚úÖ **Testing utilities**: Reduced test duplication by ~60%
- ‚úÖ **Production Deployment**: Lambda functions deployed and data reset
- ‚úÖ **Verification**: All conversations now display messages correctly

**Status**: Bug fix successfully deployed to production with fresh data.

## üîß **PRIORITY 0: Multi-Machine Infrastructure Management** üö® **BLOCKING ISSUE**

### **Current Problem**
- Local Terraform state files preventing coordination between machines
- Persistent AWS provider timeout issues on macOS (laptop)
- Unable to deploy or manage infrastructure from secondary machines

### **Solution: Implement S3 Remote State Backend**

#### **Implementation Plan**
1. **On primary machine (desktop mini)**:
   - Create S3 bucket for Terraform state: `amianai-terraform-state`
   - Create DynamoDB table for state locking: `terraform-state-lock`
   - Update `backend.tf` to use S3 backend
   - Migrate existing local state to S3
   - Commit and push changes

2. **Benefits**:
   - ‚úÖ Shared state across all machines
   - ‚úÖ State locking prevents conflicts
   - ‚úÖ Automatic state backups
   - ‚úÖ Enables team collaboration
   - ‚úÖ Works around macOS provider timeout issues

3. **Migration Steps**:
   ```bash
   # On desktop mini (primary machine)
   cd infrastructure
   
   # Create backend resources
   aws s3 mb s3://amianai-terraform-state --region us-east-1
   aws dynamodb create-table \
     --table-name terraform-state-lock \
     --attribute-definitions AttributeName=LockID,AttributeType=S \
     --key-schema AttributeName=LockID,KeyType=HASH \
     --provisioned-throughput ReadCapacityUnits=5,WriteCapacityUnits=5
   
   # Update backend.tf
   # Then migrate state
   terraform init -migrate-state
   ```

**Status**: Ready to implement on desktop mini after git pull

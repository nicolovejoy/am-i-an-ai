# AmIAnAI Next Steps

## üéØ Current Status (2025-06-26)

### ‚úÖ **Platform Operational**

- Core tests passing (56 backend + 359+ frontend tests)
- Infrastructure deployed (PostgreSQL, Lambda API, CloudFront/S3)
- Authentication working (Cognito JWT)
- AI integration functional (OpenAI responses persist to database)
- Admin console and CLI tools working
- **‚úÖ SECURITY IMPLEMENTED**: Backend permission system completed with single source of truth
- **‚úÖ JOIN SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED**: Conversation join endpoint with comprehensive permission checks

### üõ†Ô∏è **Development Workflow**

- **Code Implementation**: Claude implements fixes and features
- **Deployment**: User handles all infrastructure deployment (Lambda, infrastructure scripts)
- **Testing**: Claude runs tests and validation, user manages deployment verification

## üöÄ **Immediate Next Steps**

### **Priority 0: Frontend Join UI**

**Goal**: Add frontend interface for joining public conversations.

**Implementation**:
1. **Join Button**: Add join buttons to conversation list for public conversations
2. **Participant Management**: UI for viewing current participants
3. **Success Feedback**: Confirm successful joins with updated participant list

### **Priority 1: Conversation State Management**

1. **Close Conversations**: UI controls for conversation closure (initiator + admin only)
2. **State Indicators**: Visual status and participant management
3. **Message Blocking**: Enforce can_add_messages based on state
4. **History Tracking**: Rich audit trail with actor attribution

### **Priority 2: Enhanced UX**

1. **Multi-Participant UI**: Support 3+ participants in conversations
2. **Real-time Updates**: Conversation state changes and new participants
3. **AI Agent Configuration**: Admin interface for updating AI capabilities

## üìä **Technical Architecture**

### **Database**: PostgreSQL with JSONB

- Flexible participants array (no more 2-person limit)
- Rich state management (status, permissions, history)
- Soft deletes and complete audit trail
- Schema versioning for future evolution

### **‚úÖ Completed: Security & Permission System**

**Backend PermissionEngine**: Single source of truth for all authorization decisions
- Private/Public/Unlisted conversation support
- User role-based access (admin override)
- Persona ownership validation
- Extensible rule system for future needs

**Frontend Simplification**: 80% code reduction
- Removed duplicate permission logic
- Components respect API-provided permissions
- Clean separation of concerns

### **‚úÖ Completed: Join Conversation System**

**Backend Join Endpoint**: `POST /conversations/:id/join`
- Comprehensive permission validation (10 test scenarios)
- Conversation state checks (active, late joining, max participants)
- Admin privileges and audit trail
- Integration with permission system

**Test Coverage**: 56 backend tests passing
- 10 join endpoint tests with TDD approach
- Complete error scenario coverage
- Proper test isolation and mocking

### **Key Features Ready**

- Variable participant counts with dynamic joining
- Comprehensive permission system with single source of truth
- Conversation state management with audit trail
- Permission-based actions and UI controls
- Type-safe JSONB operations and extensible architecture

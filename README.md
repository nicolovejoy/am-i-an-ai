# Am I an AI

An interactive space for humans and AIs to converse.

## Project Structure

- `frontend/` - React TypeScript application
- `infrastructure/` - Terraform configuration for AWS infrastructure
  - `bootstrap/` - Initial Terraform state management resources
  - `main.tf` - Main infrastructure configuration
  - `variables.tf` - Variable definitions
  - `outputs.tf` - Output definitions
  - `backend.tf` - S3 backend configuration

## Current Infrastructure

- Terraform state management:
  - ✅ S3 bucket for state storage
  - ✅ DynamoDB for state locking
- Website hosting (in progress):
  - ⏳ S3 bucket for static website
  - ⏳ CloudFront distribution
  - ⏳ SSL/TLS certificate
  - ⏳ Route53 DNS configuration

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Complete infrastructure deployment

   - [ ] Wait for ACM certificate validation
   - [ ] Verify CloudFront distribution
   - [ ] Test domain configuration

2. [ ] Set up GitHub Actions

   - [ ] Create AWS IAM user for deployments
   - [ ] Add repository secrets:
     - [ ] AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
     - [ ] AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
     - [ ] CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID

3. [ ] Deploy initial React app

   - [ ] Build the application
   - [ ] Upload to S3 bucket
   - [ ] Verify deployment

4. [ ] Add more features to the React app

   - [ ] Chat interface
   - [ ] User authentication
   - [ ] AI integration

5. [ ] Set up monitoring and logging

   - [ ] CloudWatch metrics
   - [ ] Error tracking
   - [ ] Performance monitoring

6. [ ] Security enhancements

   - [ ] WAF configuration
   - [ ] Security headers
   - [ ] Rate limiting

7. [ ] Environment management
   - [ ] Set up development environment
   - [ ] Configure staging environment
   - [ ] Production environment controls

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Deploy infrastructure:

   ```bash
   cd infrastructure/bootstrap
   terraform init
   terraform apply

   cd ..
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

## Progress Log

### Day 1: Infrastructure Setup

We've established the foundational infrastructure using Terraform and AWS:

1. **State Management**

   - Created an S3 bucket for Terraform state storage with versioning enabled
   - Set up DynamoDB table for state locking
   - Configured remote backend for collaborative development

2. **Project Structure**

   - Initialized React TypeScript application
   - Created Terraform configurations for infrastructure
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployments
   - Established project documentation

3. **Initial AWS Infrastructure**

   - Configured provider settings for multiple AWS regions
   - Started deployment of core services:
     - S3 bucket for website hosting
     - CloudFront distribution for content delivery
     - ACM certificate for HTTPS
     - Route53 DNS configuration

4. **Security Foundations**
   - Implemented S3 bucket policies
   - Configured CloudFront security settings
   - Set up SSL/TLS certificate
   - Established IAM roles and policies

Next session will focus on completing the infrastructure deployment and setting up the deployment pipeline through GitHub Actions.

I have a Vite website for a robot orchestra app and want to add some visualfeedback to button interactions. When users click buttons, I want:

A visual pulse/ripple effect that emanates from the click point
A subtle scale animation on button press

Please implement this as reusable functions that I can apply to any button element. I'd like the solution to:

Be customizable (different pulse colors, haptic intensities)
Support both pulse and glow effect options

The visual style should feel modern and Gen Z-friendly with smooth animations. Make it feel premium and responsive."
